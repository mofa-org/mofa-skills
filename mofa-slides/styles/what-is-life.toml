Create a presentation slide image. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Medium lavender/purple gradient — from #C8B8E0 (medium lavender) at top-left to #D8CCE8 (soft purple) at bottom-right. Richer purple than pastel, elegant and premium.

In the right half, include VERY FAINT wireframe sketches (at 10-15% opacity) of four iconic science shapes: a DNA double helix, an atom with electron orbits, a crystal lattice structure, and a Boltzmann entropy equation — overlapping subtly like a collage watermark. Drawn in faint purple lines (#A090C0). They should NOT compete with the text.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Sans SC font for ALL text. ALL text in Chinese ONLY — absolutely NO English anywhere on the slide except proper nouns like "What is Life?".
- Main title: font-weight 700, color #1A1A2E (very dark navy/black), 48-54pt
- Subtitle: font-weight 300, color #4A3A6E (muted purple), 20-24pt

The LEFT 50% should be clear for the title. Minimal, elegant, dramatic.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Dark navy (#0B1929), solid, elegant, premium.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Sans SC font (clean Chinese sans-serif) for ALL text. ALL text in Chinese ONLY — absolutely NO English anywhere on the slide.
- Title: font-weight 700, color #00B4D8 (bright cyan), size 28-32pt, top-left aligned
- Body: font-weight 300, color #CCCCCC (light gray), size 16-18pt
- Stat numbers: font-weight 700, color #FFB703 (amber gold), size 48-64pt

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL):
ALL diagrams use sophisticated WIREFRAME SKETCH illustration in CYAN/TEAL tones:
- Cyan (#00B4D8) line art on dark backgrounds — thin, elegant lines (~1.5-2px)
- DETAILED icons with character: atoms with orbital shells, wave functions, crystal lattice nodes, Boltzmann distribution curves, quantum energy level diagrams
- Hand-drawn/sketch quality but CLEAN and READABLE — like a senior physicist's concept whiteboard on a dark canvas
- Arrows are clean with proper arrowheads in cyan
- Labels in clean Noto Sans SC near their icons
- Cards use dark card backgrounds (#132F4C) with thin cyan left border, rounded corners (12px)
- Generous white space inside each card — diagrams breathe, never cramped

CRITICAL: Premium consulting deck aesthetic (McKinsey / BCG quality) with hand-drawn wireframe concept sketches in cyan on dark navy. Apple Keynote level whitespace and typography. Intellectual, sophisticated, scientific.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL):
ALL diagrams use sophisticated WIREFRAME SKETCH illustration in TEAL/GREEN tones:
- Teal (#14B8A6) and complementary colors (#00B4D8 cyan, #FFB703 amber) line art
- DETAILED icons: DNA double helix with base pair rungs, chromosome X-shapes, cell membranes with phospholipid bilayers, mitosis spindle fibers, enzyme lock-and-key shapes
