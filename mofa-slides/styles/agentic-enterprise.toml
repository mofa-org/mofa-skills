Create a presentation slide image. 3840×2160 pixels, 16:9 landscape format. HIGH RESOLUTION 4K — every detail crisp and sharp.

BACKGROUND: Pale lavender gradient (#F8F5FC → #EDE6F6). Soft, warm, premium feel — NOT cold white.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- English text: Manrope font (geometric modern sans-serif)
- Chinese text: Noto Sans SC font (clean Chinese sans-serif)
- Title: font-weight 700, 24pt, color #2D1B69 (deep purple), LEFT-ALIGNED. Title only — NO subtitle, NO footer, NO page number.
- Section headers: font-weight 700, 20-22pt, #2D1B69, LEFT-ALIGNED
- Body: font-weight 300, color #444444, 16-18pt, LEFT-ALIGNED
- Stat numbers: font-weight 700, Manrope, 48-64pt
- Keep English terms in English: SaaS, Claude Code, L1/L2/L3/L4/L5, Hands On, Feet Off, Eyes Off, Minds Off, Copilot, IDE, MCP, Skills, Rust, etc. Chinese for everything else.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL — MOST IMPORTANT):
Every slide MUST have LARGE, DETAILED WIREFRAME illustrations that are PROMINENT — not tiny decorative icons.
- WIREFRAME LINE ART style — clean outlines, NO solid color fills, NO photo-realistic rendering
- Purple-gray line color (#7B6B8D to #9B7FD4), line weight ~1.5-2px
- Illustrations should be LARGE SCENE COMPOSITIONS occupying ~35-40% of the slide
- Detailed wireframe elements: monitors with visible screen content, server racks with individual drives, network graphs with labeled nodes, brain outlines with neural pathways, gear mechanisms with visible teeth
- Each card/section should have its own wireframe illustration — NOT text-only
- Think: McKinsey strategy deck concept illustrations but BIGGER and more detailed
- Labels in clean UPPERCASE Manrope text beside wireframe elements
- NO solid color fills, NO gradients on illustrations, NO wireframe effects — pure line art

LAYOUT:
- Illustrations are PROMINENT — each slide needs a large wireframe scene
- Cards: white background, thin purple left border (#7C3AED), FLAT — NO shadow. Completely flat boxes.
- 0.5" minimum margins. Breathing room.

Clean, institutional, authoritative. Detailed wireframe illustrations with purple-toned premium aesthetic.
