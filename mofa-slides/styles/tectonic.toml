Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Light purple gradient — from pale lavender-white (#F8F5FC) at top-left to soft lavender (#EAE0F5) at bottom-right. Elegant, soft, not too saturated — think frosted lilac glass. In the background, VERY FAINTLY visible (like a ghosted watermark at 5-8% opacity), include a gentle sketch outline of a large whale silhouette — positioned in the right half of the slide. Just barely-visible faint purple-gray pencil lines, like a watermark printed on fine paper. The whale should NOT compete with the content.

TYPOGRAPHY: Manrope font (geometric modern sans-serif, clean and rounded) for ALL English text. Noto Sans SC font (clean Chinese sans-serif, matching weight) for ALL Chinese text. Clean, professional, highly legible.

TITLE RULES:
- Title font size MUST be ≤24pt. If the title is long, shrink to 20pt or 18pt to fit.
- If the Chinese translation is SHORT (≤8 characters), put English and Chinese on ONE line separated by " | " — e.g. "The AGI Implication | AGI的启示"
- If the Chinese translation is LONG (>8 characters), use TWO lines: English title on line 1, Chinese title on line 2 in slightly smaller text.
- Subtitle (if any) goes below the title in medium gray, ~14-16pt.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL):
ALL diagrams use sophisticated MONOCHROME WIREFRAME SKETCH illustration:
- Medium gray (#666666 to #888888) line art ONLY — NO color fills, NO heavy gradients
- DETAILED icons with character: gear teeth clearly drawn, building columns visible, brain with neural connections, shield emblems detailed, screens show content
- Consistent line weight throughout (~1.5-2px equivalent)
- Hand-drawn/sketch quality but CLEAN and READABLE — like a senior designer's concept whiteboard sketch
- Arrows are clean with proper arrowheads
- Labels in clean UPPERCASE Manrope gray text, positioned near their icons
- Generous white space inside each card — diagrams should breathe, not feel cramped

The light purple gradient background should be VISIBLE — cards are white so they contrast against the soft lavender background. The overall color feeling is elegant purple/lavender.

CRITICAL: Premium consulting deck aesthetic (McKinsey / Bain style) with hand-drawn concept sketches — intellectual, sophisticated, monochrome diagrams on elegant light purple background.

BACKGROUND: Light purple gradient — from pale lavender-white (#F8F5FC) at top-left to soft lavender (#EAE0F5) at bottom-right. Very subtle, clean. Minimal or NO whale watermark on this slide — keep the background clean for data readability.

TYPOGRAPHY: Manrope font (geometric modern sans-serif) for ALL English text. Noto Sans SC for ALL Chinese text. Clean, professional, highly legible.

TITLE RULES:
- Title font size MUST be ≤24pt. If the title is long, shrink to 20pt or 18pt to fit.
- If the Chinese translation is SHORT (≤8 characters), put English and Chinese on ONE line separated by " | "
- If the Chinese translation is LONG (>8 characters), use TWO lines: English title on line 1, Chinese title on line 2 in slightly smaller text.

DATA-DENSE SLIDE: This slide contains dense data tables or comparison matrices. PRIORITIZE data presentation clarity above all else. Reduce or remove decorative sketch elements. Use clean table layouts with maximum readability. Data > decoration. Tables should have clear headers, aligned columns, generous spacing, and alternating subtle row shading for readability. Only keep minimal wireframe accents that aid comprehension (small icons in table cells OK), never at the expense of data legibility.

Premium consulting deck aesthetic — clean, intellectual, data-forward.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Dark purple gradient — from deep midnight purple (#1A0F40) at top-left to rich purple (#3D2580) at bottom-right. Rich, elegant, dramatic.

In the right half of the slide, include a VISIBLE but subtle sketch of a large whale silhouette — drawn in light purple/lavender wireframe lines (#C4B5D9, #E8DFF5) at ~20-30% opacity. The whale is "falling" gracefully, with small particles and dots rising below it (representing "一鲸落万物生" — when a whale falls, all things flourish). The whale is sketch/wireframe style, NOT photorealistic.

TYPOGRAPHY: Manrope font (geometric modern sans-serif) for English. Noto Sans SC for Chinese. On dark background, text should be white or very light lavender.

The LEFT 40% of the slide should be relatively clear for text content. The whale sketch occupies the RIGHT 60%.

Premium, dramatic, cinematic but still intellectual and clean.
