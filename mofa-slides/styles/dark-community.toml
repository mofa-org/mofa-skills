Create a presentation slide image. 3840×2160 pixels, 16:9 landscape format. HIGH RESOLUTION 4K — every detail crisp and sharp.

BACKGROUND: White (#FFFFFF) to very light cool gray (#F5F7FA). Clean, corporate, institutional — Linux Foundation press release style.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- English text: Manrope font (geometric modern sans-serif)
- Chinese text: Noto Sans SC font (clean Chinese sans-serif)
- Title: font-weight 700, color #003366 (deep corporate blue), 32-36pt
- Section headers: font-weight 700, 20-24pt
- Body: font-weight 300, color #444444, 16-18pt
- Badge/stat text: font-weight 700
- ALL TEXT IN CHINESE. Do NOT repeat English translations of Chinese text. English only for proper nouns (AGENTS.md, NLSpec, Vouch, Attractor, PR-Agent).

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL — THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART):
Every level MUST have LARGE, DETAILED illustrations that dominate the visual space. Text is secondary.
- Corporate blue (#003366, #0066CC, #4A90D9) as primary palette with teal (#00A99D) and navy accents
- ABSTRACT AI FIGURES — NOT cartoonish robots. Use:
  * Glowing orbs / neural network nodes / constellation patterns to represent AI agents
  * Abstract geometric shapes (hexagons, circles, flowing curves) for intelligence
  * Gradient light trails and connection beams for agent-to-agent communication
  * Soft luminous halos around AI nodes — sophisticated, almost spiritual
  * Minimal human figures — only use simple silhouettes when absolutely necessary, keep them small
- Accent colors: teal (#00A99D) for trust/approval, coral (#E8636F) for rejection
- CLEAN CORPORATE vector-style illustrations — NOT hand-drawn sketches
- Think: Linux Foundation annual report, World Economic Forum infographic, Deloitte digital transformation deck
- Each illustration should be LARGE scene compositions, not tiny icons
- Cards use white background with thin blue left border, NO SHADOW, rounded 12px. NO drop shadows or shading on any card or panel.
- Generous whitespace — institutional, authoritative

Linux Foundation corporate PR aesthetic. Clean, institutional, authoritative, forward-looking.
