Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or very faint warm gray (#FAFAFA). Absolutely clean — no gradients, no textures, no patterns, no watermarks. Just pristine white space.

TYPOGRAPHY: Inter or Helvetica Neue for ALL text. Noto Sans SC (clean Chinese sans-serif, matching weight) for ALL Chinese text. Extreme typographic discipline.
- Title: font-weight 700, color pure black (#000000), 28-32pt, left-aligned
- Body text: font-weight 300, color dark charcoal (#333333), 16-18pt
- Secondary text: font-weight 300, color medium gray (#888888), 14pt
- Numbers/stats: font-weight 700, color #D4382C (Scandinavian red), 48-64pt

DESIGN RULES (CRITICAL):
- EXTREME WHITESPACE — at least 100px margins on all sides. Content should feel like it's floating in open space. Less is more.
- Single accent color: Scandinavian red (#D4382C) — used ONLY for key numbers, one highlight word, or a single thin line. Never more than 10% of the visual area.
- NO illustrations, NO icons, NO decorative elements, NO shadows, NO gradients on anything
- If data needs visual separation, use only: thin hairline rules (0.5px, #E0E0E0), generous spacing, or subtle alternating white/#F5F5F5 rows
- Content cards: NO borders, NO shadows — separate content areas with whitespace alone, or at most a single thin left border in red (#D4382C, 2px)
- Everything aligned to a strict grid. Mathematical precision in spacing.
- Think: Muji product catalog, Kinfolk magazine, Dieter Rams "less but better"

CRITICAL: This must feel like a Scandinavian design studio's internal presentation — austere, confident, every element earning its place. The white space IS the design. If it doesn't feel empty enough, remove more.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Pure white (#FFFFFF). Clean and unadorned.

TYPOGRAPHY: Inter or Helvetica Neue for English. Noto Sans SC for Chinese. Extreme clarity.
- Title: font-weight 700, color pure black (#000000), 24-28pt, left-aligned
- Table headers: font-weight 700, color black, 14-16pt
- Table body: font-weight 300, color #333333, 14-16pt
- Highlight numbers: font-weight 700, color #D4382C (Scandinavian red)

DATA-DENSE SLIDE RULES:
- Tables use the absolute minimum visual structure: thin hairline rules (#E0E0E0, 0.5px) for row/column separation
- NO heavy borders, NO colored headers, NO cell backgrounds except very subtle alternating rows (#FAFAFA)
- Column alignment is critical — numbers right-aligned, text left-aligned
- Generous row height and column spacing for readability
- Comparison highlights: use red (#D4382C) text or a single red dot indicator — never color fills
- If showing pricing: display numbers prominently in red, context in gray

CRITICAL: Data should speak for itself. The design disappears — only information remains. Bloomberg Terminal minimalism meets Swiss typography.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Pure black (#000000). Solid, absolute, dramatic.

TYPOGRAPHY: Inter or Helvetica Neue for English. Noto Sans SC for Chinese.
- Main title: font-weight 700, pure white (#FFFFFF), 48-56pt, left-aligned, positioned in the left half
- Subtitle: font-weight 300, medium gray (#888888), 20-24pt, below title
- NO other text, NO decorations, NO logos

DESIGN:
- The RIGHT side of the slide has ONE single design element: a large thin-line geometric shape in Scandinavian red (#D4382C) — such as a circle outline (2px stroke), or a single vertical line, or a simple cross mark. Just ONE shape, large scale, mathematically placed.
- The contrast of black background + white text + single red geometric element creates maximum visual impact with minimum elements.
- At least 60% of the slide should be empty black space.

CRITICAL: Absolute minimalism. Black, white, red. Three elements only: background, text, one geometric accent. Nothing else.
