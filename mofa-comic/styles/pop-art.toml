prompt = """
Create a single comic panel image in Pop Art style (Roy Lichtenstein).

DRAWING STYLE:
- Bold black outlines (thick, 3-4px) with FLAT primary color fills
- Ben-Day dots (halftone dot pattern) for shading and color gradients — this is THE signature element
- Limited color palette: primary red (#FF0000), yellow (#FFD700), blue (#0066CC), black, white
- High contrast, graphic, poster-like impact
- No subtle shading — only Ben-Day dots at different densities for tonal variation

CHARACTER DESIGN:
- Idealized comic book characters: strong jawlines, dramatic expressions
- Women with flowing hair, red lips, dramatic eye makeup (classic Lichtenstein woman)
- Men with chiseled features, determined expressions
- Emotions are DRAMATIC and EXAGGERATED — tears, surprise, anger, passion

BACKGROUNDS:
- Bold flat color or Ben-Day dot patterns
- Simple geometric shapes or starburst patterns for emphasis
- No detailed environments — the character and text ARE the composition

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Bold block letters in speech bubbles or thought balloons
- Thought balloons with cloud-like borders
- Dramatic text: "POW!", "WHAM!", "OH NO!" in large decorated letters
- Text can be the main visual element

COMPOSITION:
- Close-up crops — face filling the panel, dramatic angles
- High contrast between thick black outlines and bright colors
- Every element pops with maximum visual impact

CRITICAL: This must look like a Roy Lichtenstein painting — the Ben-Day dots are essential, the colors are primary and bold, the emotions are melodramatic. Commercial art elevated to fine art.
