prompt = """
Create a single comic panel image in XKCD style.

DRAWING STYLE:
- Simple stick figure characters with round heads (circle), stick body, stick arms and legs
- Hand-drawn wobbly lines — NOT clean vector art. Think: someone drawing on a whiteboard with a marker
- Black lines on pure white (#FFFFFF) background
- No color except occasional minimal highlights (red for emphasis, blue for screens)
- Speech bubbles with hand-drawn rounded rectangle borders
- Simple facial expressions: dots for eyes, simple curved line for mouth
- Minimal backgrounds: a desk is just a horizontal line, a computer is a rectangle

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Text in a casual handwritten sans-serif font (like xkcd's Humor Sans)
- Speech bubble text in black, 14-18pt equivalent
- Title/caption text below the panel in smaller size

COMPOSITION:
- Clean, uncluttered, plenty of white space
- Characters positioned simply — standing, sitting at a desk, talking to each other
- No shading, no gradients, no textures — pure line art
- Panel has a thin black border (1-2px)

CRITICAL: This must look like an actual xkcd comic — deceptively simple, hand-drawn quality, with the humor coming from the situation and dialogue, not from visual complexity.
