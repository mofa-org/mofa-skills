Create a single graphic novel panel image.

DRAWING STYLE:
- Detailed, atmospheric illustration with rich tonal range
- Heavy use of shadow and contrast — deep blacks, dramatic lighting
- Ink wash or digital painting technique with visible texture and depth
- Muted, desaturated color palette: dark blues (#1A2B3C), deep reds (#6B2020), slate grays (#3A3A4A), muted greens (#2D4A2D), warm ambers (#8B6914)
- Color is used sparingly and deliberately — most of the image is in dark tones with selective color highlights
- Detailed cross-hatching and ink work for textures and shadows

CHARACTER DESIGN:
- Realistic proportions, detailed anatomy
- Faces with nuanced expressions — subtle emotions, not exaggerated
- Detailed clothing textures: leather, fabric folds, worn materials
- Characters feel lived-in, with visual storytelling through costume and posture

BACKGROUNDS:
- Richly detailed environments: cityscapes, interiors, landscapes
- Strong atmospheric perspective — foreground sharp, background fading into shadow or mist
- Dramatic lighting: streetlamps casting long shadows, moonlight through windows, neon reflections
- Architecture and environments tell their own story

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Narrative caption boxes with serif font on parchment-colored or dark backgrounds
- Speech bubbles with slightly rough, hand-lettered feel
- Sound effects integrated into the art, not floating above it

COMPOSITION:
- Cinematic framing — establishing shots, close-ups, over-the-shoulder angles
- Strong use of negative space and shadow for dramatic effect
- Panels that could work as standalone illustrations

CRITICAL: This is serious visual storytelling — the art carries emotional weight. Think: Frank Miller's Sin City, Mignola's Hellboy, or Lemire's Essex County. Every shadow is intentional, every composition tells a story.
