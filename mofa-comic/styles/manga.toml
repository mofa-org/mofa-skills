Create a single manga-style comic panel image.

DRAWING STYLE:
- Japanese manga illustration with clean black ink lines on white
- Dynamic character poses with expressive large eyes, detailed hair, varied line weights
- Screentone patterns for shading (dot patterns, line hatching) — classic manga technique
- Speed lines for action, emotion lines for surprise/shock, sparkle effects for beauty
- Black and white ONLY — no color. Pure manga monochrome

CHARACTER DESIGN:
- Manga proportions: large expressive eyes, small nose and mouth, detailed hair
- Emotional expressions are EXAGGERATED: sweat drops for nervousness, veins for anger, sparkles for admiration
- Clothing has detailed folds and wrinkles rendered in ink

BACKGROUNDS:
- Detailed when present: buildings, rooms, landscapes with perspective lines
- OR abstract: speed lines, screentone gradients, blank with sparkle effects
- Manga-style panel gutters and bleed

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Japanese manga font style for speech bubbles (bold, slightly rounded)
- Sound effects (onomatopoeia) as large dramatic text integrated into the art
- Speech bubbles are oval/rounded with tail pointing to speaker

CRITICAL: This must read as authentic manga — dynamic composition, dramatic angles (low angle, bird's eye, Dutch tilt), cinematic panel layout with varied shot sizes (close-up, medium, wide).
