Create a single comic panel image in Ligne Claire (clear line) style.

DRAWING STYLE:
- Uniform line weight throughout — every outline is the same thickness (~1.5-2px), no variation
- Clean, precise lines with no sketchy quality — technical precision
- Flat color fills with NO shading, NO gradients, NO highlights
- Colors are bright but not neon: primary red, blue, yellow, clean green, warm brown
- No hatching, no screentones, no textures — pure flat color areas bounded by clean lines
- This is the style of Herge (Tintin), Edgar P. Jacobs, and Joost Swarte

CHARACTER DESIGN:
- Semi-realistic proportions (not chibi, not exaggerated)
- Simple but recognizable faces: dot eyes or simple oval eyes, clear nose line, simple mouth
- Clothing has clean folds drawn with uniform lines
- Characters are expressive through pose and gesture, not through exaggerated facial features

BACKGROUNDS:
- Detailed, architecturally accurate backgrounds with the same uniform line weight
- Buildings, streets, interiors drawn with careful perspective
- Every object outlined with the same consistent line — no variation in thickness

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Clean sans-serif font in speech bubbles
- Oval speech bubbles with clean thin borders
- Sound effects in bold block letters

CRITICAL: The hallmark of Ligne Claire is the democratic line — every element (character, background, object) drawn with equal precision and identical line weight. No line is more important than another. Flat colors, no shadows.
