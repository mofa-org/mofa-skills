BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese ink-wash painting (水墨画) style landscape. Misty mountains in layered silhouettes — from pale gray-blue at the back to deep indigo in the foreground. Phoenix Mountain (凤凰山) range with ancient tea terraces faintly visible on slopes. Morning mist rising between peaks. Subtle wash of warm golden light from one edge suggesting dawn.

- Mist: white to pale cream #FFFAF0 with 40-60% transparency
- Tea garden accent: muted sage green #7D9B76
- Dawn warmth: pale gold #F5DEB3 at 20% opacity
- Text: warm charcoal #3C3226 on light areas, cream #FFFAF0 on dark areas

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC (elegant Chinese serif) for titles, Noto Sans SC for body. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE. English only for proper nouns.
- Title: 700 weight, 44-52pt, warm charcoal or cream depending on background
- Subtitle: 300 weight, 20-24pt

ILLUSTRATION STYLE (CRITICAL):
Lingnan painting school (岭南画派) aesthetic — the Chaoshan regional variant:
- Traditional Chinese ink-wash brush strokes with wet-on-wet bleeding effects
- Botanical elements: tea leaves, phoenix dancong tea bushes, orchids, mountain flora painted in classical Chinese brush style
- Birds: occasionally a phoenix silhouette or mountain birds in ink
- NOT Western watercolor. NOT digital vector art. This is TRADITIONAL CHINESE PAINTING with bold brushwork, splashed ink (泼墨), and the characteristic Lingnan "clash of water and powder" (撞水撞粉) technique
- Generous empty space (留白) — the blank space IS part of the composition, like a classical Chinese painting scroll
- Premium, contemplative, scholarly atmosphere
