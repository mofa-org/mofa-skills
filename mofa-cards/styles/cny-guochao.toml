Create a greeting card image. 1080x1920 pixels, 9:16 PORTRAIT format (taller than wide).

This is a GREETING CARD, not a presentation slide. The entire image is one cohesive piece of art — a single vertical composition.

BACKGROUND: Rich Chinese red (#CC2936) as dominant base, with gradient transitions to deep crimson (#8B0000) at edges. Gold (#D4AF37) accents woven throughout as clouds, borders, or light rays.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 国潮 (Guochao / Neo-Chinese):
- Modern reinterpretation of traditional Chinese art. Bold, confident outlines with flat color fills and subtle texture.
- Think: modern Chinese poster art meets traditional woodblock print meets street art energy.
- NOT photorealistic. NOT cute cartoon. NOT watercolor. It is BOLD, GRAPHIC, and VIBRANT.
- Key motifs: dragon (龙), red lanterns (红灯笼), plum blossoms (梅花), golden clouds (祥云), paper-cut patterns (剪纸), firecrackers (鞭炮), red envelopes (红包).
- Illustration should fill 60-70% of the card. Large, dramatic, and filling the vertical space.
- Colors: red (#CC2936, #B22222), gold (#D4AF37, #FFD700), black ink outlines, touches of warm white (#FFF5E6).

TYPOGRAPHY: ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY.
- Main greeting: 1-4 large Chinese characters in bold calligraphic style, gold (#FFD700) or warm white, 72-96pt equivalent. Examples: "恭贺新禧", "新春大吉", "龙年大吉".
- Place text where it integrates naturally with the illustration — not floating disconnected.
- Font feel: Noto Serif SC or bold Chinese calligraphy, confident brush energy.
- NO English text anywhere on the card.

COMPOSITION: Vertical flow — illustration and text interweave from top to bottom. The eye travels naturally down the card. No rigid grid. Organic yet balanced.

CRITICAL: This must feel like a premium Chinese New Year greeting card — the kind you'd buy at a high-end stationery store in Beijing or Shanghai. Festive, bold, culturally rich, and modern.

This is a GREETING CARD for Chinese New Year. The emphasis is on the BLESSING TEXT with decorative support.

BACKGROUND: Deep red (#9B1B30) to crimson (#CC2936) gradient, or rich gold (#D4AF37) with red accents. Warm and inviting.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 国潮 (Guochao / Neo-Chinese):
- Decorative elements frame the text: golden clouds (祥云) at top and bottom, plum blossom branches along edges, paper-cut style borders, small lantern motifs.
- Illustration occupies 30-40% of the card — it supports the text, not overwhelms it.
- Style: bold outlines, flat color fills, traditional Chinese decorative patterns reimagined with modern graphic energy.
- Colors: red (#CC2936), gold (#D4AF37, #FFD700), black ink accents, warm white (#FFF5E6).

TYPOGRAPHY: ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY.
- Main greeting: 4-8 large characters, bold calligraphic style, gold or warm white, centered or artfully placed. 60-80pt equivalent.
- Secondary blessing: 2-4 lines of smaller text (24-32pt), warm white or light gold, expressing New Year wishes.
- Example text layout:
  "恭贺新禧" (large, prominent)
  "万事如意 阖家欢乐" (medium)
  "新的一年 平安喜乐" (smaller, elegant)
- Font feel: Noto Serif SC for body, bold Chinese calligraphy for main greeting.

COMPOSITION: Text is the hero. Centered vertically with generous breathing room. Decorative elements create a frame or gentle border without competing with the message.

CRITICAL: Balance between text and decoration. The blessing must be instantly readable. The decorations enhance the festive mood without clutter. Premium quality, warm and heartfelt.

This is a SCENIC greeting card for Chinese New Year — a full illustration that tells a story of celebration and reunion.

BACKGROUND: The scene itself IS the background. Rich, warm color palette dominated by reds, golds, and warm amber tones.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 国潮 (Guochao / Neo-Chinese):
- A complete vertical scene depicting Chinese New Year celebration. Full-bleed illustration, edge to edge.
- Possible scenes: family reunion dinner (年夜饭) with a round table of dishes; a traditional Chinese village/street with hanging red lanterns and fireworks in night sky; children in traditional clothing playing with firecrackers and sparklers; a traditional Chinese courtyard (四合院) decorated for New Year with spring couplets (春联) on doors.
- Style: bold graphic illustration, modern Guochao aesthetic. Strong outlines, layered flat colors with texture. Warm lighting — lantern glow, firecracker sparks, golden ambient light.
- NOT photorealistic. Think: editorial illustration for a premium Chinese lifestyle magazine.
- Rich detail but organized composition — the eye can rest and explore.

TYPOGRAPHY: ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY.
- Minimal text: just 2-4 characters subtly integrated into the scene. Example: "新春快乐" on a lantern, or "福" on a door decoration. The text is PART of the scene, not overlaid.
- Font: traditional Chinese calligraphy style, as if hand-written on a lantern or banner within the scene.

COMPOSITION: Vertical storytelling — the scene unfolds from top (sky/fireworks) to bottom (ground/people). Depth through layering: foreground details, middle-ground action, background atmosphere.

CRITICAL: This should feel like a collectible art print — a Chinese New Year scene so beautiful and rich that you'd want to frame it. Warm, nostalgic, celebratory, and culturally authentic.
