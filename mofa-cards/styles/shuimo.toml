Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Warm rice paper texture (#FFF8F0 to #FFFAF2). Subtle Xuan paper grain visible. The off-white warmth of aged rice paper. NOT pure white — organic, handmade, warm.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 水墨画 (Chinese Ink-Wash):
- A bold ink-wash illustration occupies the RIGHT 50-60% of the slide: mountains in mist, bamboo grove, plum branches, or flowing water — rendered in traditional Chinese ink technique with varying gray tones and confident brush strokes.
- RED (#CC2936) used as ONE accent: a single red seal stamp, plum blossom petals, or a small red lantern. Never more than 10% of visual area.
- The LEFT side is mostly empty rice paper with the title text.
- 30-40% of the slide should be 留白 (empty space). The emptiness IS the design.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC for ALL text. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY.
- Main title: font-weight 700, pure black ink (#1A1A1A), 48-56pt, left-aligned, positioned in the left 40%.
- Subtitle: font-weight 300, warm gray (#666666), 22-26pt, below title with generous spacing.
- A small red seal stamp (印章) near the title — a square red mark, traditional touch.

CRITICAL: This must feel like the cover page of a hand-bound Chinese art book — refined, spacious, culturally elegant. The ink illustration and the emptiness create balance. Wu Guanzhong's landscape simplicity meets modern presentation design.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Warm rice paper (#FFF8F0). Subtle paper grain texture. Clean, warm, organic.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 水墨画 (Chinese Ink-Wash):
- Small ink-wash accent illustrations as decorative elements — NOT the main focus. Examples: a spray of bamboo leaves in a corner, a single plum branch along one edge, a few ink-wash mountain silhouettes at the bottom, or wisps of ink-wash clouds.
- Illustrations occupy only 15-25% of the slide — they support the content, not compete.
- RED (#CC2936) used sparingly: a plum petal, a seal stamp, or a thin accent line. Maximum 5-8% of visual area.
- Brush strokes: confident, varying thickness, traditional Chinese painting technique.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC for titles, Noto Sans SC for body. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY.
- Title: font-weight 700, black ink (#1A1A1A), 28-32pt, left-aligned
- Body text: font-weight 300, dark charcoal (#333333), 16-18pt, generous line spacing
- Secondary text: font-weight 300, warm gray (#888888), 14pt
- Key numbers or highlights: font-weight 700, RED (#CC2936), large
- Use very subtle pale warm washes (#FFF5E8, #F5F0EB) to group content areas — NO hard borders, NO card shadows

LAYOUT: Generous whitespace throughout. Content breathes. At least 80px margins. Group content with subtle wash backgrounds or single ink-brush divider strokes instead of geometric lines.

CRITICAL: This is NOT a corporate slide. It should feel like an elegant page from a Chinese art studio's handbook — information presented with ink-wash grace. Every element earns its place.

Create a presentation slide image. 1920×1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape format.

BACKGROUND: Warm rice paper (#FFF8F0). Clean, warm.

ILLUSTRATION STYLE — 水墨画 (Chinese Ink-Wash):
- Minimal ink decoration: just a faint bamboo leaf spray or mountain silhouette in one corner, very light gray (20-30% opacity). Decoration must NOT interfere with code or data readability.
- RED (#CC2936) for emphasis only: key parameter names, important values.

TYPOGRAPHY: ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY for labels and descriptions.
- Title: Noto Serif SC, font-weight 700, black (#1A1A1A), 28-32pt
- Code/API text: monospace feel (clear, readable), dark charcoal (#333333), 14-16pt
- Use a very subtle warm background wash (#F5F0EB or #FFF5E8) for code blocks — like ink on slightly different paper. NO hard borders.
- Parameter names in bold or RED (#CC2936) for emphasis
- Comments/descriptions in warm gray (#888888)

LAYOUT: Clean and readable. Code blocks with generous padding and line spacing. Left-aligned. If showing a table or parameter list, use thin ink-brush-style dividers (#DDD5C8), not geometric grid lines.

CRITICAL: Data clarity is paramount, but maintain the ink-wash warmth. Think: a coding manual printed on handmade paper.
