ART STYLE (CRITICAL — this is the MOST important instruction):
Feng Zikai (丰子恺) painting style. This is a SPECIFIC Chinese art tradition:
- Very simple, minimal brush strokes — just a few lines to suggest a figure
- Round-headed children with dot eyes and no detailed facial features
- Adults drawn with slightly more detail but still extremely minimal
- Light color washes: pale pink, soft amber, gentle green, muted blue — like watercolor thinned to 20-30% opacity
- Black or dark brown ink outlines, confident single brush strokes, never sketchy or tentative
- LOTS of empty white/cream space (留白) — at least 40% of the image should be blank
- Compositions feel like a page from a children's picture book or a scroll painting
- Warm, nostalgic, innocent, gentle — capturing everyday family moments
- Often includes a short line of calligraphic Chinese text as part of the painting (NOT separate)
- Objects are simplified to their essence: a teapot is just a round body + spout + handle in 3 strokes
- Mountains are 2-3 ink wash strokes suggesting misty peaks
- Tea bushes are simple curved lines with a few leaf shapes
- NO photorealism, NO digital art, NO detailed rendering — this must look HAND-PAINTED with brush and ink on rice paper

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#FFF8F0), like aged Chinese rice paper. Subtle paper texture. NO gradients, NO patterns.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC for any text overlays. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY. NO English anywhere.
- Title text: 700 weight, warm charcoal #3C3226
- Body text: 300 weight, warm gray #6B5E50
- Text should feel like handwritten annotations on a painting, not corporate text boxes

CRITICAL: This must look like an actual Feng Zikai painting — minimal, warm, with the naive charm of a master who draws with deliberate simplicity. Think of it as a painting first, a slide second.

ART STYLE (CRITICAL):
Feng Zikai (丰子恺) painting style applied to an informational layout:
- Small ink-wash illustrations as accent elements (NOT the main focus)
- Simple brush-stroke icons: teapot, cup, child figure, steam wisps, tea leaves, mountain silhouette
- Light color wash backgrounds for content areas: very pale amber (#FFF5E8), pale green (#F0F7ED), soft pink (#FFF0F0), pale blue (#F0F5FF)
- All illustrations are Feng Zikai style: minimal lines, round-headed figures, simplified objects
- Hand-painted feel throughout — even dividers and borders should look like single brush strokes, not clean geometric lines

BACKGROUND: Warm off-white (#FFF8F0), rice paper texture. Clean, airy.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC for headers, Noto Sans SC for body. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY. NO English anywhere.
- Section headers: 700 weight, 24-28pt, warm charcoal #3C3226
- Body: 300 weight, 16-18pt, warm gray #5D4E37
- Accent text/stats: 700 weight, soft ink black #2C2C2C or amber #B8860B
- Key quotes in calligraphic style, integrated with illustrations

LAYOUT: Generous whitespace. Content areas use very subtle pale color washes instead of hard-edged cards. NO corporate card borders — instead, group content with color washes and brush-stroke dividers. Each content area should breathe.

CRITICAL: This is NOT a corporate slide. It should feel like an illustrated page from a warm family guidebook, with Feng Zikai's gentle hand visible in every element.

ART STYLE (CRITICAL):
Feng Zikai (丰子恺) painting at its most poetic and minimal:
- ONE central illustration, very simple, occupying about 30-40% of the space
- Surrounding empty space is PART of the composition — it conveys tranquility
- The illustration captures a single warm moment: a hand pouring tea, a child looking up, steam rising, a mountain path
- Light, almost transparent color wash — just a hint of amber or pink
- One or two lines of calligraphic text integrated INTO the painting composition
- This should feel like the most beautiful page in a Feng Zikai art book

BACKGROUND: Warm cream (#FFFAF2), pristine, like high-quality rice paper.

TYPOGRAPHY: Noto Serif SC, integrated with the painting. ALL TEXT IN CHINESE ONLY. NO English anywhere.
- Quote text: 700 weight, 28-36pt, warm charcoal #3C3226
- Attribution/subtitle: 300 weight, 16pt, warm gray #8B7D6B

CRITICAL: Extreme minimalism. Every brush stroke must earn its place. This is meditation in visual form.
