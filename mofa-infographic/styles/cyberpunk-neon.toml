Create an infographic header section. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape.

BACKGROUND: Deep dark navy (#0A0E1A) to dark teal (#0D1B2A) gradient. Rich, atmospheric.

DESIGN:
- Large bold title text in white (#FFFFFF) or electric cyan (#00D4FF), 48-64pt
- Subtitle in light gray (#8892A0), 20-24pt
- Thin neon accent lines (#00D4FF, #FF6A00) as decorative elements: horizontal rules, corner brackets, grid lines
- Subtle holographic or circuit pattern at 10-15% opacity in the background
- Futuristic HUD-style corner decorations

TYPOGRAPHY: Clean futuristic sans-serif (Inter, Barlow, or Rajdhani style).

ATMOSPHERE: Dark, premium, tech-forward. Think: a high-tech dashboard header.

[variants.normal]
prompt = """
Create an infographic content section. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape.

BACKGROUND: Dark navy (#0A0E1A) — consistent with other sections.

DESIGN:
- KPI cards or stat callouts on semi-transparent dark panels (#0A0E1A at 80% opacity) with thin cyan (#00D4FF) borders
- Large stat numbers in electric cyan (#00D4FF) or neon orange (#FF6A00), 48-72pt bold
- Stat labels in light gray (#8892A0), 14-18pt
- Data visualizations: bar charts, progress bars, or node graphs in neon colors
- Thin grid lines at 5-10% opacity for structure
- Icons in thin line style, cyan or white

TYPOGRAPHY: Clean sans-serif. White for headings, gray for body, cyan/orange for accent numbers.

CRITICAL: Data-forward — the numbers and charts are the heroes. Neon accents draw the eye to key metrics.
"""

[variants.footer]
prompt = """
Create an infographic footer section. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape.

BACKGROUND: Deep dark navy (#0A0E1A), slightly darker than body sections.

DESIGN:
- Sources and credits in small light gray (#666666) text, 10-12pt
- Thin cyan (#00D4FF) horizontal rule at the top separating from content
- Optional: small logo placeholder area, QR code placeholder
- Minimal decorative elements: fading circuit pattern, subtle grid
- Clean, understated — this section supports, doesn't compete

TYPOGRAPHY: Small, light weight, gray tones. Clean sans-serif.
