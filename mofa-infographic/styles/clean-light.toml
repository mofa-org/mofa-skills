- Extreme white space — at least 40% of the section is empty
- No decorations except one thin colored accent line

[variants.normal]
prompt = """
Create an infographic content section. 1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 landscape.

BACKGROUND: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or very faint gray (#FAFAFA).

DESIGN:
- Data presented in clean cards with NO borders and NO shadows — separated by white space alone
- Large bold numbers in accent color (blue #0066CC or teal #00A99D), 48-64pt
- Labels in dark gray (#444444), 14-16pt
- Simple flat icons in medium gray (#888888) for categories
- Bar charts or progress bars in accent color with gray (#E0E0E0) track
- Generous padding between all elements — nothing feels cramped
- If using a table: minimal hairline rules, alternating faint row shading (#F5F5F5)

TYPOGRAPHY: Sans-serif. Dark for text, accent color for key numbers only.

CRITICAL: Extreme clarity. Every data point is instantly readable. No decoration for decoration's sake. The data IS the design.
